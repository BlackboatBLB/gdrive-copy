This software uses the [ramda](http://ramdajs.com/) library.

However, since it is hosted with Google Apps Script, it is not possible to `require` it
like a normal person would in a normal web app.

So, the workaround: In every file that uses ramda, there is a declaration that looks like this:

`var R = this.R ? this.R : require('ramda');`

R is exported from [the source code](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/blob/master/dist/ramda.js), 
so when deploying, it is possible to just copy and paste the ramda distributino code into a separate 
`gs` file.  But, in local development, this statement allows ramda to be `require`d and used normally.

IMPORTANT: Ramda must be placed first in the Google Apps Script project or it won't work.
